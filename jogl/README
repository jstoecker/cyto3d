Cyto3D needs the JOGL library to run. This directory contains the files needed
to package the JOGL library into an OSGi bundle.

Run the build.sh script to create the two JARs. They will be output to bin/.

These two JARs need to be in ~/CytoscapeConfiguration/3/apps/installed/ along
with the main app JAR.

NOTES
***************

For JOGL to be used in an OSGi environment it needs access to the following
packages:

javax.swing
sun.nio.ch
apple.awt (on OS X only)
sun.awt (on Windows only)

The javax.swing package is exported by the system bundle, but the other three
packages are not. To get access to these, a second JAR is created which is a
system bundle fragment; this uses the system bundle as a host, and it will
export the extra packages that are needed.

jogl_main-2.1.0.jar contains the actual JOGL library classes and native code
jogl_extension-2.1.0.jar is the system bundle fragment

Ideally I would have jogl_extension-2.1.0.jar export sun.awt along with
sun.nio.ch and apple.awt (and import this package in jogl_main-2.1.0.jar).
Unfortunately, this creates issues inside of Cytoscape. Instead, Windows users
will need to modify the org.osgi.framework.bootdelegation to include sun.*.
This is found in Cytoscape/framework/etc/custom.properties.
